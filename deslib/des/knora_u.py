    """k-Nearest Oracles Union (KNORA-U).
    
    This method selects all classifiers that correctly classified at least
    one sample belonging to the region of competence of the query sample. Each
    selected classifier has a number of votes equals to the number of samples in the
    region of competence that it predicts the correct label. The votes obtained by all
    base classifiers are aggregated to obtain the final ensemble decision.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pool_classifiers : list of classifiers
                       The generated_pool of classifiers trained for the corresponding classification problem.
                       The classifiers should support the method "predict".

    k : int (Default = 7)
        Number of neighbors used to estimate the competence of the base classifiers.

    DFP : Boolean (Default = False)
          Determines if the dynamic frienemy pruning is applied.

    with_IH : Boolean (Default = False)
              Whether the hardness level of the region of competence is used to decide between
              using the DS algorithm or the KNN for classification of a given query sample.

    safe_k : int (default = None)
             The size of the indecision region.

    IH_rate : float (default = 0.3)
              Hardness threshold. If the hardness level of the competence region is lower than
              the IH_rate the KNN classifier is used. Otherwise, the DS algorithm is used for classification.
