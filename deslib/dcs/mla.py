class MLA(DCS):
    """Modified Local Accuracy (MLA).
    
    Similar to the LCA technique. The only difference is that the output of each base classifier
    is weighted by the distance between the test sample and each pattern in the region of competence 
    for the estimation of the classifiers competences. Only the classifier that achieved the highest
    competence level is select to predict the label of the test sample x.

    The MLA method selects the base classifier presenting the highest competence level. In a case
    where more than one base classifier achieves the same competence level, the one that was evaluated first
    is selected. The selection methodology can be modified by changing the hyper-parameter selection_method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pool_classifiers : list of classifiers
                       The generated_pool of classifiers trained for the corresponding classification problem.
                       The classifiers should support the method "predict".

    k : int (Default = 7)
        Number of neighbors used to estimate the competence of the base classifiers.

    DFP : Boolean (Default = False)
          Determines if the dynamic frienemy pruning is applied.

    with_IH : Boolean (Default = False)
              Whether the hardness level of the region of competence is used to decide
              between using the DS algorithm or the KNN for classification of a given query sample.

    safe_k : int (default = None)
             The size of the indecision region.

    IH_rate : float (default = 0.3)
              Hardness threshold. If the hardness level of the competence region is lower than
              the IH_rate the KNN classifier is used. Otherwise, the DS algorithm is used for classification.

    selection_method : String (Default = "best")
                       Determines which method is used to select the base classifier
                       after the competences are estimated.

    diff_thresh : float (Default = 0.1)
                  Threshold to measure the difference between the competence level of the base
                  classifiers for the random and diff selection schemes. If the difference is lower than the
                  threshold, their performance are considered equivalent.

    rng : numpy.random.RandomState instance
          Random number generator to assure reproducible results.

        """estimate the competence of each base classifier :math:`c_{i}` for
        the classification of the query sample using the Modified Local Accuracy (MLA) method.

        The competence level of the base classifiers is estimated by its classification accuracy taking
        into account only the samples belonging to a given class :math:`w_{l}`.In this case, :math:`w_{l}` is
        the class predicted by the base classifier :math:`c_{i}`, for the query sample. This method also weights
        the influence of each training sample according to its Euclidean distance to the query instance.
        The closest samples have a higher influence in the computation of the competence level. The
        competence level estimate is represented by the following equation:

        .. math:: \\delta_{i,j} = \\sum_{k = 1}^{K}P(\\omega_{l} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{k} \\in \\omega_{l}, c_{i} )W_{k}

        where :math:`\\delta_{i,j}` represents the competence level of :math:`c_{i}` for the classification of
        query.
