class APosteriori(BaseDCS):
    """A Posteriori Dynamic classifier selection.

    The A Posteriori method uses the probability of correct classification of a
    given base classifier :math:`c_{i}` for each neighbor :math:`x_{k}` with
    respect to a single class. Consider a classifier :math:`c_{i}` that assigns
    a test sample to class :math:`w_{l}`. Then, only the samples belonging to
    class :math:`w_{l}` are taken into account during the competence level
    estimates. Base classifiers with a higher probability of correct
    classification have a higher competence level. Moreover, the method also
    weights the influence of each neighbor :math:`x_{k}` according to its
    Euclidean distance to the query sample. The closest neighbors have a higher
    influence on the competence level estimate. In cases where no sample in the
    region of competence belongs to the predicted class, :math:`w_{l}`, the
    competence level estimate of the base classifier is equal to zero.

    A single classifier is selected only if its competence level is
    significantly higher than that of the other base classifiers in the pool
    (higher than a pre-defined threshold). Otherwise, all classifiers in the
    pool are combined using the majority voting rule. The selection methodology
    can be modified by modifying the hyper-parameter selection_method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pool_classifiers : list of classifiers (Default = None)
        The generated_pool of classifiers trained for the corresponding
        classification problem. Each base classifiers should support the method
        "predict" and "predict_proba". If None, then the pool of classifiers is
        a bagging classifier.

    k : int (Default = 7)
        Number of neighbors used to estimate the competence of the base
        classifiers.

    DFP : Boolean (Default = False)
        Determines if the dynamic frienemy pruning is applied.

    with_IH : Boolean (Default = False)
        Whether the hardness level of the region of competence is used to
        decide between using the DS algorithm or the KNN for classification of
        a given query sample.

    safe_k : int (default = None)
        The size of the indecision region.

    IH_rate : float (default = 0.3)
        Hardness threshold. If the hardness level of the competence region is
        lower than the IH_rate the KNN classifier is used. Otherwise, the DS
        algorithm is used for classification.

    selection_method : String (Default = "best")
        Determines which method is used to select the base classifier after
        the competences are estimated.

    diff_thresh : float (Default = 0.1)
        Threshold to measure the difference between the competence level of the
        base classifiers for the random and diff selection schemes. If the
        difference is lower than the threshold, their performance are
        considered equivalent.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    knn_classifier : {'knn', 'faiss', None} (Default = 'knn')
         The algorithm used to estimate the region of competence:

         - 'knn' will use :class:`KNeighborsClassifier` from sklearn
         - 'faiss' will use Facebook's Faiss similarity search through the
           class :class:`FaissKNNClassifier`
         - None, will use sklearn :class:`KNeighborsClassifier`.

    DSEL_perc : float (Default = 0.5)
        Percentage of the input data used to fit DSEL.
        Note: This parameter is only used if the pool of classifier is None or
        unfitted.

        The competence level is estimated based on the probability of correct

        :math:`x_{k}` belonging to a specific class :math:`w_{l}`.
        In this case, :math:`w_{l}` is  the class predicted by the base

        Euclidean distance to the query instance. The closest samples have a
        higher influence in the computation of the competence level. The
        competence level estimate is represented by the following equation:
