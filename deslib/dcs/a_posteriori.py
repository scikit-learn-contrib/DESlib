#    This method works similarly to the LCA technique. The only difference is that it uses
#    the scores obtained by the base classifiers as well as the distance between the test sample
#    and each pattern in the region of competence are also considered in the competence estimation.


class APosteriori(DCS):
    """A Posteriori Dynamic classifier selection.

    The A Posteriori method uses the probability of correct classification of a given base classifier :math:`c_{i}`
    for each neighbor :math:`x_{k}` with respect to a single class. Consider a classifier :math:`c_{i}` that assigns
    a test sample to class :math:`w_{l}`. Then, only the samples belonging to class :math:`w_{l}` are taken into
    account during the competence level estimates. Base classifiers with a higher probability of correct
    classification have a higher competence level. Moreover, the method also weights the influence of each
    neighbor :math:`x_{k}` according to its Euclidean distance to the query sample. The closest neighbors have a higher
    influence on the competence level estimate. In cases where no sample in the region of competence belongs to the
    predicted class, :math:`w_{l}`, the competence level estimate of the base classifier is equal to zero.

    A single classifier is selected only if its competence level is
    significantly higher than that of the other base classifiers in the pool (higher than a pre-defined threshold).
    Otherwise, all classifiers in the pool are combined using the majority voting rule. The selection methodology can
    be modified by modifying the hyper-parameter selection_method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pool_classifiers : list of classifiers
                       The generated_pool of classifiers trained for the corresponding classification problem.
                       The classifiers should support methods "predict" and "predict_proba".

    k : int (Default = 7)
        Number of neighbors used to estimate the competence of the base classifiers.

    DFP : Boolean (Default = False)
          Determines if the dynamic frienemy pruning is applied.

    with_IH : Boolean (Default = False)
              Whether the hardness level of the region of competence is used to decide
              between using the DS algorithm or the KNN for classification of a given query sample.

    safe_k : int (default = None)
             The size of the indecision region.

    IH_rate : float (default = 0.3)
              Hardness threshold. If the hardness level of the competence region is lower than
              the IH_rate the KNN classifier is used. Otherwise, the DS algorithm is used for classification.

    selection_method : String (Default = "best")
                       Determines which method is used to select the base classifier
                       after the competences are estimated.

    diff_thresh : float (Default = 0.1)
                  Threshold to measure the difference between the competence level of the base
                  classifiers for the random and diff selection schemes. If the difference is lower than the
                  threshold, their performance are considered equivalent.

    rng : numpy.random.RandomState instance
          Random number generator to assure reproducible results.

    def estimate_competence(self, query):
        """estimate the competence of each base classifier :math:`c_{i}` for
        the classification of the query sample using the A Posteriori method.

        The competence level is estimated based on the probability of correct classification of the base classifier
        :math:`c_{i}`, for each neighbor :math:`x_{k}` belonging to a specific class :math:`w_{l}`.
        In this case, :math:`w_{l}` is  the class predicted by the base classifier :math:`c_{i}`, for the query sample.
        This method also weights the influence of each training sample according to its Euclidean distance to the
        query instance. The closest samples have a higher influence in the computation of the competence level. The
        competence level estimate is represented by the following equation:

        .. math:: \\delta_{i,j} = \\frac{\\sum_{\\mathbf{x}_{k} \\in \\omega_{l}}P(\\omega_{l} \\mid
            \\mathbf{x}_{k}, c_{i} )W_{k}}{\\sum_{k = 1}^{K}P(\\omega_{l} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{k}, c_{i} )W_{k}}

        where :math:`\\delta_{i,j}` represents the competence level of :math:`c_{i}` for the classification of
