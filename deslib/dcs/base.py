class DCS(DS):
    """Base class for a Dynamic Classifier Selection (dcs) method.
    All dynamic classifier selection classes should inherit from this class.

    Warning: This class should not be used directly, use derived classes instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pool_classifiers : list of classifiers
                       The generated_pool of classifiers trained for the corresponding classification problem.
                       The classifiers should support methods "predict" and "predict_proba".

    k : int (Default = 7)
        Number of neighbors used to estimate the competence of the base classifiers.

    DFP : Boolean (Default = False)
          Determines if the dynamic frienemy pruning is applied.

    with_IH : Boolean (Default = False)
              Whether the hardness level of the region of competence is used to decide
              between using the DS algorithm or the KNN for classification of a given query sample.

    safe_k : int (default = None)
             The size of the indecision region.

    IH_rate : float (default = 0.3)
              Hardness threshold. If the hardness level of the competence region is lower than
              the IH_rate the KNN classifier is used. Otherwise, the DS algorithm is used for classification.

    selection_method : String (Default = "best")
                       Determines which method is used to select the base classifier
                       after the competences are estimated.

    diff_thresh : float (Default = 0.1)
                  Threshold to measure the difference between the competence level of the base
                  classifiers for the random and diff selection schemes. If the difference is lower than the
                  threshold, their performance are considered equivalent.

    rng : numpy.random.RandomState instance
          Random number generator to assure reproducible results.

        between its competence level and the competence level of the other base classifiers is higher than a predefined
        threshold). If no base classifier is significantly better, the base classifier is selected randomly among the
