class Rank(DCS):
    """Modified Classifier Rank.

    The modified classifier rank method evaluates the competence level of each individual classifiers
    and select the most competent one to predict the label of each test sample :math:`x`.
    The competence of each base classifier is calculated as the number of correctly classified samples,
    starting from the closest neighbor of :math:`x`. The classifier with the highest number of correctly classified
    samples is considered the most competent.

    The Rank method selects the base classifier presenting the highest competence level. In a case
    where more than one base classifier achieves the same competence level, the one that was evaluated first
    is selected. The selection methodology can be modified by changing the hyper-parameter selection_method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pool_classifiers : list of classifiers
                       The generated_pool of classifiers trained for the corresponding classification problem.
                       The classifiers should support the method "predict".

    k : int (Default = 7)
        Number of neighbors used to estimate the competence of the base classifiers.

    DFP : Boolean (Default = False)
          Determines if the dynamic frienemy pruning is applied.

    with_IH : Boolean (Default = False)
              Whether the hardness level of the region of competence is used to decide
              between using the DS algorithm or the KNN for classification of a given query sample.

    safe_k : int (default = None)
             The size of the indecision region.

    IH_rate : float (default = 0.3)
              Hardness threshold. If the hardness level of the competence region is lower than
              the IH_rate the KNN classifier is used. Otherwise, the DS algorithm is used for classification.

    selection_method : String (Default = "best")
                       Determines which method is used to select the base classifier
                       after the competences are estimated.

    diff_thresh : float (Default = 0.1)
                  Threshold to measure the difference between the competence level of the base
                  classifiers for the random and diff selection schemes. If the difference is lower than the
                  threshold, their performance are considered equivalent.

    rng : numpy.random.RandomState instance
          Random number generator to assure reproducible results.
