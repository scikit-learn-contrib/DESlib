The :mod:`deslib.util` This module includes various utilities. They are divided into four parts:

deslib.util.aggregation - Implementation of aggregation functions such as majority voting and averaging.
Such functions can be applied to any list of classifiers.

deslib.util.diversity - Implementation of different measures of diversity between classifiers.

deslib.util.prob_functions - Functions to estimate the competence of a base classifier based on the
probability estimates.

deslib.util.instance_hardness - Functions to measure the hardness level of a given instance
