Dynamic selection vs K-NN: Using instance hardness
====================================================================

One aspect about dynamic selection techniques is that it can better deal with
the classification of test examples associated with high degree of instance
hardness. Such examples are often found close to the border of the classes,
with the majority of its neighbors belonging to different classes.
On the other hand, the KNN method, which is often used to estimate the region
of competence in DS methods works better in the classification of examples
associated with low instance hardness [1].

DESlib already implements a switch mechanism between DS techniques and the KNN
classifier according to the hardness level of an instance. This example
varies the threshold in which KNN is used for classification instead of DS
methods. It also compares the classification results with the standard KNN
as a baseline.

The switch mechanism also reduces the computational cost involved since only
part of the test samples are classified by the DS method.
