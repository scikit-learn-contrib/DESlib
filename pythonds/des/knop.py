class KNOP(DES):
    """k-Nearest Output Profiles (KNOP).

    Parameters
    ----------
    pool_classifiers : type, the generated_pool of classifiers trained for the corresponding
    classification problem.

    k : int (Default = 7)
        Number of neighbors used to estimate the competence of the base classifiers.

    DFP : Boolean (Default = False)
          Determines if the dynamic frienemy pruning is applied.

    with_IH : Boolean (Default = False)
              Whether the hardness level of the region of competence is used to decide between
              using the DS algorithm or the KNN for classification of a given query sample.

    safe_k : int (default = None)
             The size of the indecision region.

    IH_rate : float (default = 0.3)
              Hardness threshold. If the hardness level of the competence region is lower than
              the IH_rate the KNN classifier is used. Otherwise, the DS algorithm is used for classification.

    aknn : Boolean (Default = False)
           Determines the type of KNN algorithm that is used. set to true for the A-KNN method.
