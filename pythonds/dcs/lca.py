class LCA(DCS):
    """Local Classifier Accuracy (LCA).

    Evaluates the competence level of each individual classifiers and
    select the most competent one to predict the label of each test sample.
    The competence of each base classifier is calculated based on its local 
    accuracy with respect to some output class. Consider a classifier that assigns
    a test sample to class Ci. The competence is estimated by the percentage of the local training
    samples assigned to class Ci by this classifier that have been correctly labeled.
    

    Parameters
    ----------
    pool_classifiers : list of classifiers
                       The generated_pool of classifiers trained for the corresponding classification problem.
                       The classifiers should support methods "predict" and "predict_proba".

    k : int (Default = 7)
        Number of neighbors used to estimate the competence of the base classifiers.

    DFP : Boolean (Default = False)
          Determines if the dynamic frienemy pruning is applied.

    with_IH : Boolean (Default = False)
              Whether the hardness level of the region of competence is used to decide
              between using the DS algorithm or the KNN for classification of a given query sample.

    safe_k : int (default = None)
             The size of the indecision region.

    IH_rate : float (default = 0.3)
              Hardness threshold. If the hardness level of the competence region is lower than
              the IH_rate the KNN classifier is used. Otherwise, the DS algorithm is used for classification.

    aknn : Boolean (Default = False)
           Determines the type of KNN algorithm that is used. Set to true for the A-KNN method.

    selection_method : String (Default = "best")
                       Determines which method is used to select the base classifier
                       after the competences are estimated.

    diff_thresh : float (Default = 0.1)
                  Threshold to measure the difference between the competence level of the base
                  classifiers for the random and diff selection schemes. If the difference is lower than the
                  threshold, their performance are considered equivalent.
