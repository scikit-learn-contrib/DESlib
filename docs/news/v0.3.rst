Version 0.3
===========

- Third release of the stable API. By `Rafael M O Cruz`_ , `Luiz G Hafemann`_ and `Le Thanh`_

Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* All techniques are now sklearn estimators and passes the check_estimator tests.
* All techniques can now be instantiated without a trained pool of classifiers.
* Pool of classifiers can now be fitted together with the ensemble techniques.
* Added support for Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for fast region of competence estimation on GPU.
* Added DES Multi-class Imbalance (DES-MI).
* Added a new Instance Hardness measure (KND_score).
* Added Instance Hardness support when using DES-Clustering.
* Added label encoder for the static ensemble module.
* Changed name of base classes (Adding Base to their name to follow scikit-learn standards).
* Removal of **DFP_mask**, **neighbors** and **distances** as class variables.
* Changed signature of methods **estimate_competence**, **predict_with_ds**, **predict_proba_with_ds**. They now require the neighbors and distances to be passed as input arguments.
* Added Python 3.7 support.
* New and updated examples.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed bug with META-DES when checking if the meta-classifier was already fitted.
* Fixed bug with random state on DCS techniques.
* Fixed high memory consumption on DES probabilistic methods.
* Fixed bug on Heterogeneous ensembles example and notebooks examples.
