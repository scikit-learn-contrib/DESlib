Version 0.2
===========

- Second release of the stable API. By `Rafael M O Cruz`_ and `Luiz G Hafemann`_.

Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Implemented Label Encoding: labels are no longer required to be integers starting from 0. Categorical (strings) and non-sequential integers are supported (similarly to scikit-learn).
* Batch processing: Vectorized implementation of predictions. Large speed-up in computation time (100x faster in some cases).
* Predict proba: only required (in the base estimators) if using methods that rely on probabilities (or if requesting probabilities from the ensemble).
* Improved documentation: Included additional examples, a step-by-step tutorial on how to use the library.
* New integration tests: Now covering predict_proba, IH and DFP.
* Bug fixes on 1) predict_proba 2) KNOP with DFP.
